(nates): fixed a bug that stoped the indentation of enum types
(nates): Got rid of shared_mapid keymap, global_mapid already suited that role and because we were
         using it, listers wouldn't be able to see the shared bindings because it grabs 
         and stores the mapid that is set in the "View_Context" (which I assume is the global_mapid)               during lister init ("begin_lister" function).

(nates): Changed mapid sync code to support global_mode_state 
         (you can set is_global_modal_state in custom layer)
(nates): Added b32 is_global_modal_state and global_model_state to app->cmd_context

///////////////////////

(nates): Added forward_declare CodeIndexNote for functions, jump_to_definition_at_cursor won't
         jump to forward_declarations anymore
(nates): Fixed api_parser.exe baking in code directory when building it.
         Now it dynamically makes the code directory
(nates): Fixed pressing return in *messages* panel to crash program
(nates): Delete can now use line select mode.
(nates): Reworked goto_next_mark && goto_prev_mark to have better controls.
(nates): Added line selecting, copy && cut set select_mode to false, shift+v toggles it.
(nates): Fixed mark history to be stored per file, _not_ per view && added rel_index to mark_history.

///////////////////////
date-> 7/10/22

(nates): .gitignore now ignores all the app_parser.exe files.
(nates): Fixed bug that caused crash when typing in wrong thing in jump_to_definition_sorted command.
(nates): Handled cases that caused desync between the view->mapid_state && the mapid on the view's buffer.
(nates): Added "command_mapid" and "insert_mapid" to models && app_set_maps function.
