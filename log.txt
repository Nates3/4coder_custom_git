(nates): Cleaned up code index note rendering code a little bit
(nates): Fixed code index note function highlighting having greater priority than macros
(nates): Fixed crash when setting the cursor on a view_id of zero
(nates): Fixed lister slowdown when lister->options.count increses
(nates): Fixed crash because of code indexing into files that don't exist? Idk, it was a null pointer
         dereference in default_render_buffer code index note code


///////////////////////////
date-> 7/17/22

(nates): Fixed it so Macros are highlighted
(nates): Made it so syntax highlighting acccounts for the scope position of tokens relative
         to the definition of where the struct type is
(nates): Added syntax highlighting for local structs, enums, && unions
(nates): Duct taped block comments not geting auto indented when using write_text_auto_indent


///////////////////////////

(nates): Fixed comments getting added twice due to carriage return
(nates): Fixed comment highlight not parsing inside scopes and parenthesis
(nates): TODOs and NOTEs are highlighted
(nates): forward declarations now apply to structures, unions, and enums
(nates): forward declarations now have their own highlight when definition is missing

///////////////////////////
date-> 7/15/22

(nates): Cleaned up custom word highlight to always happen _after_ the default one so it just overrides it
(nates): Fixed jump_to_definition_sorted not displaying forward declaration text
(nates): Changed execution panels to happen in the opposite panel and not the current one
(nates): Changed word_complete_drop_down to not stop looping _unless_ user presses escape or return to 
         select a piece of text to word_complete

(cakez): Added a bunch of custom command sigs && is_cutting to models

///////////////////////////
date-> 7/13/22

(nates): fixed jump_to_definition_at_cursor not prioritizing CodeIndexNote_Function over 
         CodeIndexNote_Forward_Declaration


////////////////////////
date-> 7/12/22

(nates): fixed a bug that stoped the indentation of enum types
(nates): Got rid of shared_mapid keymap, global_mapid already suited that role and because we were
         using it, listers wouldn't be able to see the shared bindings because it grabs 
         and stores the mapid that is set in the "View_Context" (which I assume is the global_mapid)               during lister init ("begin_lister" function).

(nates): Changed mapid sync code to support global_mode_state 
         (you can set is_global_modal_state in custom layer)
(nates): Added b32 is_global_modal_state and global_model_state to app->cmd_context

///////////////////////
date-> 7/11/22

(nates): Added forward_declare CodeIndexNote for functions, jump_to_definition_at_cursor won't
         jump to forward_declarations anymore
(nates): Fixed api_parser.exe baking in code directory when building it.
         Now it dynamically makes the code directory
(nates): Fixed pressing return in *messages* panel to crash program
(nates): Delete can now use line select mode.
(nates): Reworked goto_next_mark && goto_prev_mark to have better controls.
(nates): Added line selecting, copy && cut set select_mode to false, shift+v toggles it.
(nates): Fixed mark history to be stored per file, _not_ per view && added rel_index to mark_history.

///////////////////////
date-> 7/10/22

(nates): .gitignore now ignores all the app_parser.exe files.
(nates): Fixed bug that caused crash when typing in wrong thing in jump_to_definition_sorted command.
(nates): Handled cases that caused desync between the view->mapid_state && the mapid on the view's buffer.
(nates): Added "command_mapid" and "insert_mapid" to models && app_set_maps function.
