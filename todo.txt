------------BUGS-------------

[ ] - Bug: When opening a lister panel you can't execute any other cammands as if the
			leave_event_unhandled() function wasn't invoked. 

[ ] - Bug: If you press enter in the messages panel the program just crashes??

[ ] - Bug: Mark history is stored in the View and isn't associated with every individual buffer
      fix it so marks are stored with every buffer and you can change the buffer on your view panel
      without loosing your marks on the previous buffer you were working on


//////////////////////////////
---------- TODOS -------------

[ ] - Have setting to sync states between views so that when you switch panels, you're view state gets
      carried over

[ ] - Assign more keybinds

[ ] - Add predicate CodeIndexNotes for function params?
			i.e. all local variables to a function are highlighted in pink, but nowhere else?

[ ] - Add more "CodeIndexNote_Types" for syntax highlighting
  [ ] - Add CodeIndexNote_Forward_Declare type
	[x] - Add CodeIndexNote_Enum Type
  [ ] - Add CodeIndexNote_TODO type
	[ ] - Add CodeIndexNote_NOTE type
	[ ] - Add CodeIndexNote_Union type
	[ ] - Add CodeIndexNote_Global_Variable type
	[ ] - Add CodeIndexNote_Operator_Type for syntax hilighting *+-=\%#!~&

[ ] - Implement Shift + V selection in visual mode
  [ ] - Set markStart, markEnd
				could store as line_num_begin, line_num_end
				then if you're in select_line_mode, commands like copy / cut
				could change behavior
  [ ] - draw_rectangle for every line between markStart and markEnd

[ ] - Implement render text that's above / on line ScopeBegin 
			at the matching ScopeClose
			i.e.
			this_is_some_function_name(u32 index, u32 index2)
			{ 
				// function body
			} Render this -> (this_is_some_function_name(u32 index, u32 index2))

[ ] - Add functionality to change syntax coloring using theme-name.4coder file

[ ] - ? Find the code that is used by all things that change
			the active view, and insert set_modal and record_mark functions there

------- FINISHED TODOS / FIXED BUGS ---------

[x] - Jumping to definition changes the Keybinds somehow? Vim command -> jump -> 
      Insert, can't change back to Command again (Bug)
      (fixed) -> "can't change back again" was due to the view being in command mode
      but the buffer associated with the view was in insert mode, there's an if check in
      the "change_to_mode" signatures that prevented you from switching back.
      Changed a few api functions to ensure that the correct map is set based on the view->state
      changed_places -> "view_set_file", "view_set_active", and in 4ed.cpp where mouse_panel is set as the active_panel

[x] - Bug: BIG SLOWDOWN on large text files??? Made a completely new 4ed source build
      with no custom code, and the performance is out the window. We are wasting a lot of work every 
      frame
      (slowdown was because we were looping over _all_ tokens in the _entire_ file and _not_
      the visible range of the view "camera")

[X] - Implement a mark history system that records marks

[x] - Make there keymaps (keybind groups): "shared_bindings", "command_mode_bindings", "text_input_mode"

[x] - Syntax Highlighting for identifiers (it already had a basic implementation!)
			Need to figure out how to assign types to identifiers based on some context
			#define Identifier should be type macro for instance
			then need to figure out how to compare identifiers and render text using identifier color

[x] - Bug: Margin Border green indicating text mode sometimes renders even though
			command mode is enabled

[x] - Bug: When switching view buffers using ctr + i/o, 
			their keymaps need to be updated depending on the mode

[x] - Add a lister for CodeIndexNote_Types
			i.e. list all functions, list all TODOS, list all NOTES, list all MACROS, etc..

[x] - Bug?: When you open a new file it sets text mode 
  		see custom\4coder_default_hooks.cpp -> default_begin_buffer
			we should probably only do this on startup
