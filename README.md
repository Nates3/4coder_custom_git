git clone wherever,
find where vcvarsall.bat is that comes with visual studio,
paste it in code\bin\build.bat and
call build.bat from "code" directory like this: code>bin\build.bat to build source

confusingly theres's two custom folders, one in "code" directory and one under "build" directory.
I think for the source you just build in code\bin\build.bat and for fleury's custom stuff
you run build\custom\4coder_fleury\build.bat

to learn how to make custom commands you can look at code\custom\4coder_examples.cpp

and for user defined "custom_layer_init" function stuff you follow
